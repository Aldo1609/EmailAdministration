# EmailAdministration - Description

This program simulates an email generator for companies, where the worker's first name, last name and department must be entered. 
This assigns an email to the employee and a random and secure password. This new assigned email is saved in a .txt file that simulates a database where you will see the created email and the assigned password, 
all of this is presented graphically with the swing library.


# Note

The only thing you have to change is the path where the new assigned email will be saved, this is changed in the main class.
Another thing that can be changed is the company email, currently it is example.com but it can be changed as desired.
